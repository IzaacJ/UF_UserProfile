# Custom User Profile Field Sprinkle


## Install
Edit UserFrosting `app/sprinkles/sprinkles.json` file and add the following to the `require` list :
```
"lcharette/uf_userprofile": "dev-develop"
```

Run `composer update` then `composer run-script bake` to install the sprinkle.

# Usage

To add a custom profile fields to any user, you simply add a [FormGenerator](https://github.com/lcharette/UF_FormGenerator) complient schema containing the `form` key as well as the traditionnal [validation schema](https://learn.userfrosting.com/routes-and-controllers/client-input/validation). The rest is generated by this Sprinkle.

For example, you can add the following to a `schema/userProfile/myFields.json` file inside your sprinkle to add a `location`, `occupation` and `gender` user field. With providing the associated locale keys, that's all you have to do to add a new user field to your UserFrosting setup.
```
{
    "location" : {
        "validators" : {
            "length" : {
                "label" : "LOCATION",
                "min" : 1,
                "max" : 255,
                "message" : "VALIDATE.LENGTH_RANGE"
            }
        },
        "form": {
            "type": "text",
            "label": "LOCATION",
            "icon": "fa-globe"
        }
    },
    "occupation" : {
        "validators" : {
            "length" : {
                "label" : "OCCUPATION",
                "min" : 1,
                "max" : 255,
                "message" : "VALIDATE.LENGTH_RANGE"
            }
        },
        "form": {
            "type": "textarea",
            "label": "OCCUPATION",
            "icon": "fa-briefcase"
        }
    },
    "gender" : {
        "validators" : {},
        "form": {
            "type": "select",
            "label": "GENDER",
            "icon": "fa-transgender",
            "options" : {
                "1" : "GENDER.MALE",
                "2" : "GENDER.FEMALE",
                "3" : "GENDER.NEUTRAL"
            }
        }
    }
}
